# Disaster-Crsis-Logistics-Agent
Welcome to the Crisis Logistics Agent repository! 👋 This is the Capstone project I proudly built during the Google x Kaggle 5-Day AI Intensive. This agent isn't just a chatbot—it's an autonomous logistics coordinator designed to help rescue teams find critical supplies (like water and medical kits) instantly during a disaster. By leveraging Gemini 1.5 Flash and the powerful Function Calling method, the agent effectively "acts" by querying a mock inventory database and providing immediate, life-saving information. Check out the code and see how we put AI to work for real-world good! 💡
